Predicting Wine Quality
=======================
#Requirement
+ Tensorflow(gpu version)
+ python 3.6.2(Anaconda3 5.0.0 64-bit)

#About
This Machine Learning Project is Predicting Wine Quality. 
The goal of these machine learning project is to classify wine quality.
I trained Multilayer Perceptrons(MLP) which is fully connected, feedforward networks.
I used Adam Optimizer to minimize error cost.
After running this project, there will be 3 classes(bad, normal, good) of wine quality.
I used Tensorflow as machine learning tool which is open source library made by Google for machine learning and deep learning.

This project consists of project paper, code, and data set.
In data set folder, there are two data files. 
<Winequality-white-2> is the training data set, and <Winequality-red-2> is the test data set.

#How to use
In code folder, there is a python code. You can run this python code using jupyter notebook.
Before running this, you should change the data set directory in Cell number 2 and number 4.
It needs two data set, one for training and one for testing.
My data sets are in the data set folder.
